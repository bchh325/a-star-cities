# a-star-cities
Implementation of A* Algorithm to determine which is the shortest path in terms of distance to get from one city to another.

Uses straight line distance from cities as a heuristic to determine the next best fit city to expand.

Running the algorithm:
>>py a-star.py (city1) (city2) #city names are case sensitive

ex. >>py a-star.py SanDiego SanFrancisco
